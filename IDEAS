Structure
---------

1. Everything is a Layout
2. Layouts can be arranged in a Region
3. A Region is a layout as well
4. The top-level region is the Window

    #define cx_Layout_HEAD() <members...>

    typedef struct
    {
        cx_Layout_HEAD()
    } cx_Layout;

    #define cx_Region_HEAD() cx_Layout_HEAD() <members...>

    typedef struct
    {
        cx_Region_HEAD()
    } cx_Region;

    #define cx_Window_HEAD() cx_Region_HEAD() <members...>

    typedef struct
    {
        cx_Window_HEAD()
    } cx_Window;



1. A layout can have one of these 3 representations:
  - Canvas                        => Vector drawing
  - Texture                       => Bitmap rendering
  - StaticCanvas (static-texture) => Vector to bitmap
  - (Later on: Stream             => Animation/Video)

    enum
    {
        Canvas;
        Texture;
        StaticCanvas;
    } LayoutType;

    typedef struct
    {
        LayoutType type;
        union
        {
            Canvas canvas;
            Texture texture;
            StaticCanvas;
        }
    } Layout;
